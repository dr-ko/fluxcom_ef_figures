# Introduction: 

This repository provides access to the python scripts used to produce the figures of the following manuscript.


Jung M., Koirala S., Weber U., Ichii K., Gans F., Camps-Valls G., Papale D., Schwalm, C., Tramontana G., and Reichstein M.: "The FLUXCOM ensemble of global land-atmosphere energy fluxes."

The manuscript introduces the energy fluxes produced from the [FLUXCOM initiative](http://www.fluxcom.org) .

# Developer:
The scripts were written by [Sujan Koirala](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/bgi/index.php/People/SujanKoirala) at the [Department of Biogeochemical Integration, Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/bgi/index.php/Main/HomePage) in Jena, Germany. All questions and information shall be directed to [skoirala[at]bgc-jena.mpg.de](skoirala@bgc-jena.mpg.de).

# Usage:

The scripts are named according to the figure numbers in the manuscript. For the scripts to work, the corresponding data of the FLUXCOM energy fluxes need to be downloaded, and the paths of the data files should be changed accordingly. 

The data are freely available (CC4.0 BY licence) from the [data portal of Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/geodb/projects/Data.php) after registration.
